    <div class="hello">
      <h2>Greetings and salutations!</h2>

      <p id="bioo">My name is Andrew Hartford and I'm an aspiring web developer in the
        Austin, TX area.  I was born in San Antonio, TX in 1992 and moved around
        pretty frequently throughout my upbringing living in places like Turkey,
        England, Saudi Arabia, and all over the U.S.  I attended the University
        of Texas at Austin where I majored in Chemistry, graduating in December of
        2015.  In January of 2016, I started working as a lab analyst
        at DHL Analytical, Inc. which is an environmental lab in Round Rock.  It
        is an interesting job, however, I have a strong desire to transition into
        the tech industry.  The immense opportunity in the web-development field
        in particular really caught my attention.  It's what motivated me to apply
        to the Austin Coding Academy.  I am excited for the opportunity to be in an
        academic environment again.</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p id="bio">I have many interests, it's quite difficult to narrow things down.
        However, I will attempt to do so!  I am fascinated by the complexity of
        the world and the people, built environment, landforms, and societies within it.
        In particular, I have a great fondness for cities and urban areas.  I value
        walkable places and the concentration of amenities that come along with high
        population density.  I enjoy trying new restaurants, checking out dive bars,
        and catching a good ol' live music show here in the Live Music Capital.  I
        enjoy riding my bike around town.  Other random things that interest me:
        political activism, skyscrapers, Japan, farmers markets, bookstores, and healthy lifestyles.
        I really enjoy meeting new people and hearing about their life story and
        their own individual interests.  Expanding my mind is always something
        I'm up for.  Cheers! </p>
